GamOdroid (retroarch_fbdev_c1) is an Odroid C1/C1+/C0 optimized retroarch build distribution. It is based on RetroPie, my own customized ubuntu tiny image + kernel and use exclusively fbdev (no Xorg).

It allows to quickly play confortably a lots of retro-consoles including some N64 and Dreamcast games in full speed (eg. MarioKart, Mario64, CrazyTaxy, Sonic adventure...).

Gamodroid has been designed for lowres display (cbvs or 480p), suitable for small displays, portable projects and true NTSC composite display.

Finally, It provides a way to scrap roms (with skyscraper) to generated retroarch playlists with thumbnails and videos previews.
