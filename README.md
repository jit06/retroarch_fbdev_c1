Odroid C1/C0 optimized retroarch build scripts, based on RetroPie and hardkernel's Ubuntu minimal image.
It uses fbdev (no X) and allows to play confortably a lots of retro consoles including some n64 and dreamcast games (eg. MarioKart, Mario64, CrazyTaxy, Sonic adventure...).
It provides a way to scrap roms with skyscraper and convert de result into retroarch compatible playlists and thumbnails
It has been designed for lowres display (cbvs or 480p), suitable for small display or true NTSC composite display.

# Install with binary release
- uncompress de archive with xz (eg. ez -d gamodroidC0_v1.0.img.xz)
- write it to an emmc or sdcard with must be at least 4GB (eg. sudo dd if=gamodroidC0_v1.0.img of=/dev/sdb bs=4M)
- boot you Odroid C1/C1+/C0 with it

# Install with sources
- get official ubuntu minimal 18.04 from Hardkernel and start your Odroid C1/C1+/C0 with it.
- clone this repository in /root (git clone -depth 1 https://github.com/jit06/retroarch_fbdev_c1)
- cd /root/retroarch_fbdev_c1
- ./build.sh
- reboot
- in retroarch: use online updater to update all but cores before doing anything else

Note that it takes several hours to compile and setup everything

# Roms & scraper
- Copy your roms and bios in /root/RetroPie or change retroarch settings or mount any usbkey or sdcard to /root/Retropie (ssh is enabled)
- If you want to use a better scraper than retroarch one's, go to /root/retroarch_fbdev_c1/scraper and launch ./scraper.sh (optionals args are screenscraper login and password, eg. ./scraper.sh mylogin mypassword)

Basicaly, it's a retropie install without emulationstation.

# Main Features
- fast boot : 14 seconds to retroarch interface from cold start
- custom XMB theme and layout with video preview (press start to view it)
- consoleblank disabled
- cbvs mode set to ntsc (60fps) 
- display set to 720x480 by default (you can change it in build script, but logo and splash image won't have the right size)
- default cpu freq to 1728Mhz
- no boot message, no login message
- console cursor enabled by default (throught amiberry disable it...)
- /var/log in tmpfs (limited to 20Mb), journald log to ram
- some services disabled : rsyslog, ModemManager, pppd-dns, wpa_supplicant, loadcpufreq
- handle overscan : simply create /media/boot/overscan and put your value as "x y width height"
- handle display constrast : simply create /media/boot/contrast and write a positive or negative interger
- handle display brightness : simply create /media/boot/brightness and write a positive or negative interger
- libretro launcher for amiberry so Amiga games (lha) can be started throught retroarch
- fbneo dat files ar present in /root/.config/retroarch to get good naming with retroarch scraper

- Atari - Lynx
- Commodore - Amiga
- Sega - Dreamcast
- Sega - Game Gear

- SNK - Neo Geo Pocket Color
- NEC - PC Engine CD - TurboGrafx-CD
- NEC - PC Engine - TurboGrafx 16
- Sony - PlayStation
- Sega - 32X
- Sega - Mega-CD - Sega CD
- Nintendo - Super Nintendo Entertainment System
- Nintendo - Satellaview
- Bandai - WonderSwan
- Bandai - WonderSwan Color
- GCE - Vectrex
- Sinclair - ZX Spectrum

# Important things to note
- there is no other user than root, password is the default one : odroid
- uhs is enabled by default. Change it if your SDcard is not compatible (boot.ini)
- enable wpa_supplicant if you need wifi : systemctl enable wpa_supplicant
- Amiga emulator (amiberry) is configured to use .lha games (whdload)
- tty1 is disabled, use another one or serial or ssh to login

# Logo and splash screen
The first logo is displayed by uboot. The file boot-logo.bmp is copied to /media/boot, you can change it before launching build.sh or after the installation by changing the image in /media/boot.
This image must be a 24 bit 720x480 BMP image.
 
The splash screen can be generated using the script utils/create_splash.sh, which use the image splash.png.
Basicaly, it installs fbi, display the picture to fbdev, dump /dev/fbo and compress it to lzo.

# Todo (in no particular order)
- integrate accelerated video player for video preview
- remove uneeded patch for system.sh and amiberry (retropie has been updated)
- integrate my gpio_joypad as systemd service
- add mupen64plus-next (for now, it crashes after rom load)
- assign a default emulator during skyscraper to retroarch playlist conversion
- integrate bash launcher for retroarch and ad menu entries for changing contrast, brightness, cpu freq and display (cbvs / hdmi)
- list known n64 and dreamcast games that run correctly
- add standard help to scraper
- add an option to bypass scraper to only generate gamelist
- allow scraper script to accept all predefined variable as argument
- Test building with Linaro
