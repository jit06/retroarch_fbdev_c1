# retroarch_fbdev_c1

Odroid C1/C0 optimized retroarch build scripts, based on RetroPie and hardkernel's Ubuntu minimal image.
It uses fbdev (no X) and allows to play confortably a lots of retro consoles including some n64 and dreamcast games (eg. MarioKart, Mario64, CrazyTaxy, Sonic adventure...).
It provides a way to scrap roms with skyscraper and convert de result into retroarch compatible playlists and thumbnails
It has been designed for lowres display (cbvs or 480p).

# Install with binary release
- uncompress de archive with xz (eg. ez -d gamodroidC0_v1.0.img.xz)
- write it to an emmc or sdcard with must be at least 4GB (eg. sudo dd if=gamodroidC0_v1.0.img of=/dev/sdb bs=4M)
- boot you Odroid C1/C1+/C0 with it

# Install with sources
- get official ubuntu minimal 18.04 from Hardkernel and start your Odroid C1/C1+/C0 with it.
- clone this repository in /root (git clone -depth 1 https://github.com/jit06/retroarch_fbdev_c1)
- cd /root/retroarch_fbdev_c1
- ./build.sh
- reboot
- in retroarch: use online updater to update all but cores before doing anything else

Note that it takes several hours to compile and setup everything

# Roms & scraper
- Copy your roms and bios in /root/RetroPie or change retroarch settings or mount any usbkey or sdcard to /root/Retropie (ssh is enabled)
- If you want to use a better scraper than retroarch one's, go to /root/retroarch_fbdev_c1/scraper and launch ./scraper.sh (optionals args are screenscraper login and password, eg. ./scraper.sh mylogin mypassword)

Basicaly, it's a retropie install without emulationstation.

- enable wpa_supplicant if you need wifi : systemctl enable wpa_supplicant
- Amiga emulator (amiberry) is configured to use .lha games (whdload)
- tty1 is disabled, use another one, serial or ssh to login

# Logo and splash screen
The first logo is displayed by uboot. The file boot-logo.bmp is copied to /media/boot, you can change it before launching build.sh or after the installation by changing the image in /media/boot.
This image must be a 24 bit 720x480 BMP image.
 
The splash screen can be generated using the script utils/create_splash.sh, which use the image splash.png.
Basicaly, it installs fbi, display the picture to fbdev, dump /dev/fbo and compress it to lzo.

# Todo
- correct the bug of boot logo being trashed
- themes retroarch
- shutdown when retroarch quit
